**Abstract** This paper uses the balance sheet of China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), as a window into the country's changing financial system. The balance sheet has changed in size and composition since the mid-2000s, and I argue that those developments define a specfic periodization of central bank policy. Such a periodization clarifies discussion of financial policymaking in China, because the resulting periods are intuitive and associated with specific transactions entered into by the central bank in an observable way. With this understanding of the central bank's balance sheet as context, I consider recent discussions on the internationalization of the renminbi and on the PBOC's moves to develop and issue central bank digital currency.
